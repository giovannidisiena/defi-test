## DeFi Test

Retrieve the exact Aave health factor for a specified user address.

This is achieved by two methods:

1. Utilising the Aave protocol SDK alongside The Graph subgraph:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
2. Querying the LendingPool contract directly:
   ```
   npm aave
   ```

An example of an advanced automated DeFi trading strategy for part 2 of the case stude can be found [here](./strategy.md).
